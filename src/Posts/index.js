    quote:
      "Technology is a gift of God. After the gift of life it is perhaps the greatest of God's gifts. It is the mother of civilizations, of arts and of sciences.  It is characteristic of all deep human problems that they are not to be approached without some humor and some bewilderment. You ask: what is the meaning or purpose of life? I can only answer with another question: do you think we are wise enough to read God's mind?"

      "Religious liberty ought to be defined as distinctly as laws can admit, and the limits to religious laws established with as much solemnity as the forms of legislation can express. Every provision short of this principle will be found to leave crevices through which bigotry might introduce persecution: a monster feeding and thriving on its own venom, which will gradually swell to a size and strength overwhelming all laws human."

      "You are all my witnesses, that this is the first time of my introducing any political subject into the pulpit. At this season, however, it is not only lawful but necessary, and I willingly embrace the opportunity of declaring my opinion without any hesitation, that the cause in which America is now in arms, is the cause of justice, of liberty, and of human nature."

      "'All you people don't know about lost causes. Mr. Paine does. He said once they were the only causes worth fighting for. And he fought for them once, for the only reason any man ever fights for them; because of just one plain simple rule: 'Love thy neighbor.'... And you know that you fight for the lost causes harder than for any other. Yes, you even die for them.' Jimmy Stewart class of 1932 as Jefferson Smith in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"

    quote:
      "I mean only that those problems each and all affect the whole world; that unless they are dealt with in a spirit of unselfish and unbiased justice, with a view to the wishes, the natural connections, the racial aspirations, the security, and the peace of mind of the peoples involved, no permanent peace will have been attained. They cannot be discussed separately or in corners. None of them constitutes a private or separate interest from which the opinion of the world may be shut out. Whatever affects the peace affects mankind, and nothing settled by military force, if settled wrong, is settled at all. It will presently have to be reopened."
